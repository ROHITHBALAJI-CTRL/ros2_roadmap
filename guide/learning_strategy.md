## 🧠 THE STRATEGY: "DONE / IN PROGRESS / PLANNED"

| **Status**        | **When to Use It**                                                                 | **Example**                                    |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ **Done**        | You completed it with good understanding. Maybe did small projects/tests.          | Installed ROS2, wrote and ran your first node  |
| ⏳ **In Progress** | You’re actively working on it. Reading, coding, debugging, testing, asking doubts. | Learning pub/sub and experimenting with topics |
| 🔜 **Planned**    | You haven’t started yet, but you’ve *decided* this will be your next move.         | TF2, SLAM, Nav2 – you scheduled to learn later |

## 📌 HOW TO PLAN EFFECTIVELY (STAY ON FIRE 🔥)

### ✅ 1. **Start with WHY** for every topic

Every time you study a ROS2 concept, ask yourself:

> “Why does a robot need this?”

E.g., *“Why use TF2?” → “Because a robot needs to know where its parts and sensors are in space.”*

This makes your learning purpose-driven and powerful.

---

### ✅ 2. **Break down big topics into small, actionable parts**

For example:

Instead of:

> ❌ “Learn Navigation Stack” (too broad)

Break it into:

* ✅ Install Nav2
* ✅ Configure map server
* ✅ Launch robot with localization
* ✅ Send navigation goal using RViz
* ✅ Debug path planning

Use these as sub-tasks in a **weekly log or checklist**.

---

### ✅ 3. **Plan in 3 stages**

| Time Frame     | Purpose                                | Example                         |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| 📆 **Weekly**  | Set ONE learning focus (e.g., Pub/Sub) | Week 1 → Pub/Sub, Week 2 → TF2  |
| ⏳ **Daily**    | 1–2 tasks (read doc, build, test)      | “Write subscriber node today”   |
| 🚀 **Monthly** | Build 1 small project                  | "Simulate obstacle avoider bot" |

---

### ✅ 4. **Use a Notion or Markdown Dashboard to Plan**

In your `notes/weekly_log.md`:

```markdown
### 📆 Week of June 17 - June 23
🎯 Focus: Publisher/Subscriber in ROS2

- [x] Read official docs on Pub/Sub
- [x] Write a custom node in Python
- [ ] Connect two nodes via topics
- [ ] Echo and monitor using CLI
```

At the end of the week, write:

> ✍️ **Reflections:** I understood message passing well. QoS is tricky, revisit later.

---

### ✅ 5. **Update GitHub Roadmap Statuses Weekly**

At the start of each week:

* Move last week’s `In Progress` to ✅ Done if complete.
* Choose one `Planned` topic and mark it ⏳ In Progress.
* Add a new topic to 🔜 Planned if you're ready for next step.

This keeps your repo **alive and evolving** like a journal.

---

### ✅ 6. **Make Everything Visible (Like a Battle Log)**

Every time you:

* Solve a bug → Log it in `notes/bugs.md`
* Watch a video → Summarize in `notes/summary_*.md`
* Do a mini project → Add it to `experiments/`
* Finish a stage → Mark it ✅ in `README.md`

This makes you feel like you're **leveling up** — and you are!

---

### ✅ 7. **Every 4 Weeks: Build a Mini Project**

Use all that you've learned and build something small like:

* Follow-line bot (simulation)
* TurtleBot3 with voice control
* Slam mapping bot
* ROS2 + OpenCV camera tracker

---

## 🔥 Final Words: How YOU Should Think

You are not just “learning ROS2.”

You are:

> 🚀 **Training to command robots, contribute to space tech, ace hackathons, and become the most unstoppable version of yourself.**

**Every badge you earn, commit you push, or error you fix is proof that you’re building your future.**

---

Would you like:

* A Markdown template for your weekly/daily plan logs?
* A checklist format you can reuse in Notion or `.md`?
* GitHub issue-style progress tracker?

Just say `ros2_github_boost` and tell me which one 😎
