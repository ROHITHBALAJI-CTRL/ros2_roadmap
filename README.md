## 🎯 Final Projects I Plan to Build

- ✅ Voice-controlled TurtleBot in simulation  
- 🔜 Real robot: Obstacle avoiding bot with Lidar + Camera  
- 🔜 SLAM-enabled navigation in Gazebo  
- 🔜 AI-integrated robot assistant with object detection  
- 🔜 Multi-robot fleet simulation in ROS2

## ⚠️ Mistakes I’ve Learned From

- ❌ Forgot to source `setup.bash` → workspace tools failed  
- ❌ Subscribed to wrong topic type → no data appeared  
- ❌ Launch file syntax error → node didn’t start  
- ❌ RViz2 blank → TF wasn’t publishing  
- ❌ Didn't check topic QoS → mismatch between pub/sub

---

## 📌 Why this Repo?

This is my **ROS2 lab notebook** and a **personal portfolio** where:

- I build muscle memory through repetition  
- I debug every obstacle and document learnings  
- I help others by making mistakes public  
- I grow ready for robotics internships, hackathons, and industry roles
