# ðŸ”¥ ROS2 Learning Strategy & Mindset

This file is not about code â€” it's about *how I learn, plan, and conquer* ROS2.

It helps me:
- Plan what to learn and when
- Track progress (Planned / In Progress / Done)
- Keep fire alive with weekly and monthly goals
- Reflect on bugs, breakthroughs, and mental models
