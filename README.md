# 🤖 ROS2 Learning Roadmap
Welcome to my journey of mastering **ROS2 (Robot Operating System 2)**, a powerful open-source robotics framework. This repo tracks everything from installations to advanced robot control.

---

## 🎯 Goal

> To master ROS2 in both simulation and hardware environments, enabling me to build autonomous robots, integrate sensors, and develop real-time robotic applications.

---
## 🚀 WHY LEARN ROS2?
- 🧠 Brain of Robots: ROS2 is the middleware — it helps all parts of a robot talk to each other (sensors, motors, AI, camera, etc.).

- 🛰️ Standard in Industry: ROS2 is the future of industrial and research robotics (ROS1 is outdated).

- ⚙️ Cross-platform & Real-time: Works on Linux, Windows, and real-time systems.

- 🌐 Community, Open Source:  Millions of devs are building with ROS2.

- 🤖 Used in NASA, Tesla, Boston Dynamics: Yes — world-class robotics teams use ROS2.

## 📌 Why this Repo?

To act as my personal ROS2 lab notebook and portfolio. All steps are documented here to:
- Build muscle memory through repetition
- Track and debug problems
- Share and teach others
- Use in robotics internships or hackathons
